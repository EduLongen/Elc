      <p class="post-text"> 
        Ruby on Rails, often shortened to Rails, is a full-stack web development framework built on the Ruby programming language. It provides a pre-built structure and a set of conventions that make web development faster, easier, and more enjoyable. Think of it as a set of Legos that you can use to snap together beautiful and functional web applications.
      </p> 
                    
      <p class="post-subtitle">How Does Rails Work?</p> <br>
                    
      <p class="post-text">
        Rails follows a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the code into three distinct layers:

      <div class="text-container">
        <div class="text-pair">
          <p class="post-text-2">Model</p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Represents the data and business logic of your application.
          </p> 
			</div>
      <div class="text-pair">
        <p class="post-text-2">View</p> 
        <p class="post-text">
          Handles the presentation of your application to the user, usually through HTML and CSS.
        </p> 
      </div>
        
      <div class="text-pair">
        <p class="post-text-2">Controller</p>
        <p class="post-text">
          Acts as the middleman, receiving user requests and interacting with the model and view to generate responses
        </p> 
      </div> <br>

      <p class="post-text">
        This separation of concerns makes Rails code incredibly organized and maintainable. Plus, Rails comes with a plethora of built-in features like authentication, authorization, routing, and database management, saving you tons of time and effort.

      <p class="post-subtitle">Why is Ruby on Rails Good?</p> <br>

      <p class="post-text">
        While Rails is fantastic, it's not without its downsides. Here are a few things to keep in mind:<br><br>
        Learning Curve: Although Ruby is relatively easy to pick up, understanding the Rails conventions and framework can take some time and effort.<br><br>
